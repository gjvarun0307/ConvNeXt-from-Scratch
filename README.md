Steps followed:
1. As in paper started to code ResNet50 from scratch.
2. In ResNet paper, the ResNet 50 uses bottleneck block instead of basic block, stem block as the entey preprocessing, also implement shortcut when the channel size differs due to increse in channel size and then finally the classification head.
3.
